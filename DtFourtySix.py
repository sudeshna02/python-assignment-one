# Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple
# -------- Solution ----------------------------------

# creating a tuple
tupl = (23,24,25,25,26)
# using the len() function to know the length of a tuple
# or how many objects is present in the tuple
final_output = len(tupl)
# printing to get the result
print(final_output)
